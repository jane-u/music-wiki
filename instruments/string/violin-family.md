**Kennedy Violins**. What is _**Col legno**_?

[Col legno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_legno) is an Italian word that means “with wood”.  It’s a technique that often used with violin and other bowed stringed instruments. Col legno is used by bouncing the bow the same way you would with any other spicatto technique.
